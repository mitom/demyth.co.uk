                          We can assist with building scalable cloud infrastucture in AWS or GCP, creating an easy to operate and well maintained platform for your application to fit your needs.
                          You can expect infrastructure as code definitions via Terraform or OpenTofu, and container application templates via helm, kustomise or plain kubernetes yaml depending on your requirements.

                        We can provide assistance with getting your cloud and associated tooling costs under control. This includes identifying cost factors and excess spending. We take a hollistic approach which takes into account the purpose
                        for the resources being used, not just the dollar amount (e.g. underutilised resources needed to provide high availability are not waste!). We can help with introducing cost saving measures like commitments, spot instances, automated scaling policies
                        or occasionally just architecture or application optimisations to improve efficiency. This can extend to things like monitoring and observability cost or support tooling costs.

                      If you don't have an observability strategy, we can recommend tooling and practices and help to implement them in your application stack. If you already have tooling and are happy with it
                      we can assist with extracting maximum value for the money spent on them and minimising waste (e.g. infinite cardinality issues).
